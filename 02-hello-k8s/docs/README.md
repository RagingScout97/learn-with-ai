# Notes: Deployment and Service

Use this folder for short notes in your own words:

- What a **Deployment** does (replicas, Pod template, rollout, rollback).
- What a **Service** does (stable name, ClusterIP/NodePort, selector, load balancing).

You can also keep exportable summaries in `docs/md/` at repo root and convert to Word later.
