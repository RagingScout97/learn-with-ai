- **kubectl** – common commands: get, describe, logs, exec, port-forward, apply, delete, scale.
- **YAML snippets** – minimal Deployment, Service, Pod, ConfigMap, Secret templates for CKAD.

Add files as you build them (e.g. `kubectl.md`, `yaml-snippets.md`). Use them in every project so they become muscle memory.
